# manylabels

Many plots in the heliophysics science community are of satellites showing various physical 
observations. To place these observations in context, scientists often include multiple
x-axis labels showing, for example, the satellite location. This is surprisingly hard to implement using matplotlib. Nevertheless, `manylabels.ManyLabels()` class provides this functionality. 

## Installation

```shell
$ python -m pip install manylabels
```
